{% comment %} 
Think of it like a shortcut or a nickname.

{% url ... %}: This tells Django, "I need you to build a URL for me."

"new_challenge_path": This is the nickname (or name) you gave to one of your URL patterns in your urls.py file.

month: This is a variable. In your code, it's the current month from your {% for ... %} loop 
(e.g., "january", "february", etc.). You're passing this variable into the URL pattern.
